> A high-performance data store for geospatial files

[![Apache License, Version 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache--2.0-blue.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) [![Actions Status](https://github.com/georocket/georocket/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/georocket/georocket/actions)

GeoRocket can store geospatial files such as *3D city models (CityGML)*, *GML*
and *GeoJSON* files. Any file saved in GeoRocket can be completely restored
later. No information is lost.

Powered by popular Open-Source framework [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/),
GeoRocket offers a wide range of *high-speed search features*. You can perform
spatial queries and search for attributes, layers and tags.

GeoRocket is *ready for the Cloud*. It is event-driven and designed for
*high performance* and *scalability*. GeoRocket offers APIs and an HTTP
interface which allows it to be integrated in existing applications.

## Building

GeoRocket requires Java 8 or higher. Run the following command to build
all subprojects:

    ./gradlew build

The script automatically downloads the correct Gradle version, so you won't
have to do anything else. If everything runs successfully you may create a
distribution:

    ./gradlew installDist

If the command finishes successfully, you will find the distribution under
`build/install`.

### Building the Docker image

You may build the Docker image for GeoRocket Server locally with the following
commands:

    ./gradlew installDist
    docker build -t georocket .

## Running GeoRocket

First, follow the instructions on building the GeoRocket distribution above.

Then start GeoRocket with the following command:

    build/install/georocket/bin/georocket

You may also run it in server mode (recommended for production use):

    build/install/georocket/bin/georocket server

If you don't provide any arguments the command-line application will print
usage instructions.

### Running GeoRocket Server inside a Docker container

The fastest way to run GeoRocket Server is to use the Docker image from
Docker Hub:

    docker run --name georocket -d -p 63020:63020 georocket/georocket server

This launches GeoRocket Server in a Docker container and makes it available at
<http://localhost:63020>.

Read the [full instructions](https://hub.docker.com/r/georocket/georocket/) on
the Docker image to get more information.
